I know this looks massive, but keep calm and look carefully:

A database class.
(A1 & A2) The constructor connects to the database when $DB = new DB() is created, the destructor closes the connection.
(A3) exec() Runs an SQL query.
(A4) fetch() Runs a SELECT SQL query, returns a single row.
(A5) fetchAll() Runs a SELECT SQL query, returns multiple rows.
Database settings. Remember to change to your own.
Self-explanatory…
Yep, in “normal projects” it is better to break the database class into a script on its own. I am just being lazy and trying to keep things simple here.
